    <h3>Omurice is a food with cooked rice wrapped in an egg and topped with ketchup or other sauces. </h3>
    <p> It is a combination of the English word “omelet” (or the French word “omelette”) and “rice”</p>
    <p>It is often made not only in Western style restaurants but also in general diners and homes in Japan.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Seasoned Rice</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
        <li>Sausage chicken </li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Ketchup</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the sausage into 5 mm thick and mince the onion.</li>
        <li>Heat a frying pan, add oil (not included), and saute onions and sausages over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Put the cooked rice in a bowl, add the sauteed onions and sausage, and mix well. Add ketchup, salt and pepper and repeat mixing well.</li>
        <li>Crack the eggs into a bowl, add salt and beat well.</li>
        <li>Heat a small frying pan (20cm-22cm) over medium heat (a non-stick pan is the best).</li>
        <li>Add butter and turn the pan around to melt it, then turn the heat to low and add the eggs.</li>
        <li>Stir the eggs as if you were making scrambled eggs. Then shake the pan to prevent the eggs from sticking, and turn off the heat when the eggs are half-cooked.</li>
        <li>Place seasoned rice in the middle of the egg, lengthwise, and use a wooden spatula or heat-resistant rubber spatula to cover the rice with the egg.</li>
        <li>Hold a plate in one hand, the pan in the other hand, and flip the pan and move the omurice to the plate.</li>
        <li>Shape it into spindle form (American football shape!!).</li>
        <li>Put some ketchup in the corner of a Ziploc (plastic bag), cut the very tip a little bit, and write letters with a ketchup coming out of that part.</li>
        <li>Sereve it!!!</li>
    </ol>
