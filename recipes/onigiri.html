    <h3>This EASY onigiri recipe is flavoured with delicious Japanese seasonings and wrapped in nori, perfect for a quick snack or a tasty lunchbox treat.</h3>
    <p>These are the cutest little rice ball snacks! We love onigiri because they are so easy to adapt to your own flavour combinations, and a great way to use up leftover ingredients.</p>
    <p>You can enjoy onigiri warm, cold or at room temperature, so they are perfect in your lunchbox or as a portable snack on the go. You can even plate them up as a tasty appetiser!</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Rice</li>
        <li>Furikake</li>
        <li>Nori</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Pop your cooked rice into a nice mixing bowl. Add the furikake or rice flavouring and mix through evenly. Separate the rice into equal portions, big enough to be a large handful each.</li>
        <li>Wet your hands with water and rub together with a pinch or two of salt. This stops the rice sticking to your hands and helps keep it fresher for longer.</li>
        <li>Take up one portion of rice in your hands.</li>
        <li>If you are hiding some fillings inside, here is where you make an indent, place the ingredients inside and fold the rice over, then lightly press into a ball.</li>
        <li>Using mainly your fingertips while resting the rice on your palm, start to press and squeeze the rice into a triangular shape, rotating as you go so it is even.</li>
        <li>Place a slice of nori on the bottom of the onigiri (the rough side should face the rice) and fold it up towards to the middle of the onigiri.</li>
    </ol>
